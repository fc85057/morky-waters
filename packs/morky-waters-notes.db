But the extent of recent ship disappearances has started to eat into the profits of Grift's merchant elites. The PCs have been hired to investigate and, if possible, stop the phemonenon. Should the adventure be tied into a larger campaign, they could also be simply walking or sailing by a seaside cave along Múr, noticing an abundance of half-sunken and abandoned ships, beckoning them to investigate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What is going on</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the depths of a seaside cave along the coast of Múr dwells a horrific entity, a mess of eyes and teeth. A group of outlaws on the run hid in the cave where they encountered the beast and deemed it to be a god. Now, they sink passing ships, robbing them of their riches and sacrificing the crew to the creature, believing it to delay the onset of the next misery. There has been a recent uptick in ships missing as the cult continues to attract new members.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9MST96UwuFWa5ZQR":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.67mKiwbrxkeWbSHU"}}}
